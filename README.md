Introduction

In this project, I did the analysis for Stack Overflow Survey Data 2019. This is a survey data which I took from their website. This data contains nearly 90,000 responses from over 170 countries. I used jupyter notebook to do the analysis which you can find in the Data Science Blog Post.ipynb file.

For this analysis, I focused in answering these three questions:

1.Which country has the highest job satisfaction for developers ?

2.Is there the difference in job satisfaction between developers whose undergraduate major is IT-related an those who are not ?

3.Is there any differences in terms of salary between people who contribute to open source and those who are not?

Result Summary

After I did the analysis, these are the conclusion I found:

1.Norway has the highest job satisfaction level for developers in the world, and 5 of top 15 countries with the highest job satisfaction level are located in Europe.

2.Developers whose undergraduate major is not IT-related have slightly better job satisfaction.

3.Developers who contribute more to the open source have the higher salary (although ”does it have the direct causation?” is still debatable).
